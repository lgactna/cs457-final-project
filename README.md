Simple TETR.IO statistics collector and viewer.

Known bugs:
- Various dropdowns evaluate the available players when the application is first started, rather than when the page is loaded. This means that if a player is added for the first time via the "get player" page, they won't appear on the dropdown for the player-specific stat pages. Current workaround is to restart the application.
